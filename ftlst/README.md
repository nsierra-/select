# ftlst
Simple tools around a generic doubly linked list written in ANSI C.

# How to use it
Use the command `make` to generate `libftlst.a`, and link this file using `-L` and `-l` (on `gcc`).
Warning, this branch uses `libft` as well, see [libft](https://github.com/nsierra-/libft). Clone the `classic` branch in order to use only the classic `libc`.
